# iOS Text Styles in Sketch
A direct and true representation of iOS `UIFontTextStyle` created in Sketch

## What is this

A sketch file with `10` defined text styles directly mapped from iOS 9 [`Text Styles`](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIFontDescriptor_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/constant_group/Text_Styles) constants:

`Title1`
`Title2`
`Title3`
`Headline`
`Subheadline`
`Body`
`Footnote`
`Caption1`
`Caption2`
`Callout`

## Why

I wanted an easier and consistent way to design and build when switching between Sketch and Xcode:

* Sketch iOS template is inaccurate.
* Sketch iOS template doesn't share the same naming conventions as Xcode.
* I couldn't find any resource like this

## How to use

1. Download
2. Copy and paste the artboad into your document
3. Text styles are imported.
